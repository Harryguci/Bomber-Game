***This is a common structure for MVC Game Projects.***

# Model: 
The model represents the core game logic and data. It should contain all the code responsible for game mechanics, physics, scoring, and any other gameplay-related functionality.

*   Game logic: Code that manages game rules, player actions, and interactions between game elements.
*   Physics engine: Code that handles collision detection, gravity, and other physics-based interactions.
*   Scoreboard: Code that keeps track of the player's score and updates it as the game progresses.
*   Data storage: Code that manages saving and loading game data, such as player profiles, high scores, and game settings.

# View:
The view is responsible for displaying the game to the player. It should contain all the code responsible for rendering graphics, playing sounds, and handling user input.

*   Graphics renderer: Code that draws game elements on the screen, such as characters, backgrounds, and obstacles.
*   Sound manager: Code that plays sound effects and music during the game.
*   User input handler: Code that receives input from the player, such as mouse clicks, keyboard presses, or touchscreen taps.

# Controller:
The controller acts as the mediator between the model and the view. It should contain all the code responsible for managing the flow of the game and updating both the model and the view as needed.

*   Game manager: Code that controls the flow of the game, such as starting and ending the game, pausing and resuming gameplay, and handling game over conditions.
*   Model updater: Code that updates the model based on player actions and other game events.
*   View updater: Code that updates the view based on changes in the model or player input.

Overall, this structure provides a clear separation of concerns between the different parts of the game, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain. However, keep in mind that this is just a basic template, and the specific implementation will depend on the requirements of your game.
